# Deep Learning From Scratch
Implementation of deep learning algorithms from scratch, inspired by the Keras API.

This project is for learning purposes only, and because I enjoy implementing things from scratch.

## Features:
- Sequential model
- Dense (fully connected) layer
- ReLU activation
- Sigmoid activation
- Tanh activation
- MSE loss
- Binary cross-entropy loss
