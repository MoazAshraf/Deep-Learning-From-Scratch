# Deep Learning From Scratch
Implementation of deep learning algorithms from scratch, inspired by the Keras API.

This project is for learning purposes only, and because I enjoy implementing things from scratch.

- Layers:
  - Dense (fully connected) layer
- Activations:
  - ReLU activation
  - Sigmoid activation
  - Tanh activation
- Losses:
  - MSE loss
  - Binary cross-entropy loss
- Metrics:
  - Binary Accuracy
- Regularizers:
  - L1
  - L2
  - L1-L2
