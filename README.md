# Deep Learning From Scratch
Implementation of deep learning algorithms from scratch, inspired by PyTorch and Keras.

This project is for learning purposes only, and because I enjoy implementing things from scratch.

## Features:
- Sequential model
- Layers:
  - Linear (fully connected) layer
  - ReLU
  - Sigmoid
  - Softmax
- Loss Functions:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Binary cross-entropy
  - Categorical cross-entropy
- Metrics:
  - Binary Accuracy
  - Categorical Accuracy
